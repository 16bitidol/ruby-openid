This directory contains examples that demonstrate use of the OpenID
library.  Make sure you have properly installed this library before
running the examples.

==Ruby on Rails example
This example simply prompts the user for an
identity URL and verifies it.  This is done from the lauded Ruby on
Rails framework, and you can get a look at how it works in
app/controllers/openid_controller.rb

===Run the rails example
* Unpack openid_rails.tar.gz 
* run openid_rails/script/server
* point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

==Ruby on Rails OpenIDLoginGenerator
A port of the standard LoginGenerator that uses OpenID authentication.  Use this generator as a starting point for your OpenID enabled rails app.

You can read about LoginGenerator at http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/LoginGenerator

===Running the generator
* Copy the contents of openid_login_generator into ~/.rails/generators/openid_login
* run script/generate openid_login Auth

You will now have an auth_controller.rb in app/controllers.  For more information see the USAGE and README in the openid_login_generator directory.

==WEBrick example
consumer.rb runs a simple web server (webrick) and will verify OpenID identities.  To test this out, you'll need a valid OpenID URL, and to install the library (see ../INSTALL), and run ruby consumer.rb

Point your web browser at http://localhost:2000/ to test.
