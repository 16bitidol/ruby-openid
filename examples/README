This directory contains examples that demonstrate use of the OpenID
conusmer library.  Make sure you have properly installed this library before
running the examples.

==Ruby on Rails example
This example simply prompts the user for an
identity URL and verifies it.  This is done from the lauded Ruby on
Rails framework, and you can get a look at how it works in
app/controllers/openid_controller.rb

===Run the rails example
* Unpack openid_rails.tar.gz 
* run openid_rails/script/server
* point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

==WEBrick example
consumer.rb runs a simple web server (webrick) and will verify OpenID identities.  To test this out, you'll need a valid OpenID URL, and to install the library (see ../INSTALL), and run ruby consumer.rb

Point your web browser at http://localhost:2000/ to test.
