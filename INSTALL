= Ruby OpenID Library Installation

== Installation

Unpack the archive and run setup.rb (you may need to be root)

 irb(main):001:0> require "openid/consumer"
 => true

== Run the test suite

Go into the test directory and execute the *runtests* script.

== Next steps

* Write your own server with OpenID::Server
