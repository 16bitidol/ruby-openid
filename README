* Supports multiple storage mechanisms (Filesystem, SQL)
* Example code to help you get started, including:

  * Ruby on rails based consumer
  * Ruby on rails based server
  * OpeIDLoginGenerator for quickly getting creating a rails app that uses
    OpenID for authentication
  * ActiveRecord adapter for using an SQL store in rails
* Comprehensive test suite


==Installing
Before running the examples or writing your own code you'll need to install
the library.  See the INSTALL file.

The library has been tested using Ruby 1.8,
though it may work with earlier versions.  Examples were tested with
Rails 1.0.


==Getting Started with OpenID::OpenIDConsumer
OpenID::OpenIDConsumer is the place to start if you'd like to support
OpenID login or verification on your website.  The examples contains
several working examples to help you get started, and the
OpenID::OpenIDConsumer class is well documented.


==Serving OpenID with OpenID::OpenIDServer
The examples directory contains fully functional OpenID server that
uses the Ruby on Rails framework.  Start by reading about the
OpenID::OpenIDServer interface documentation and looking at the example.
