This OpenID consumer library is a port of the consumer functionality
of the Python-OpenID library - http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python/

Please read the INSTALL file, and then have a look at the examples
directory.  A fully functional example using Ruby's WEBrick HTTP
server library is available.  I encorage you to run the example, and
have a look at the code.

The library is well documented.  To get started, have a look at the
example source code(examples/consumer.rb) and lib/openid/consumer.rb.

To run the test suite, make sure the library is installed, use the
runtests script in the test directory.

The library and dependancies have been tested using Ruby 1.8 only,
though it may work with earlier versions.
