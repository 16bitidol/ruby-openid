=OpenID Consumer

A Ruby library for verifying OpenID identities.

This library is a port of the Python OpenID library's consumer functionality. See http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python for more info on the Python library.

==Features
* Easy to use interface (OpenID::OpenIDConsumer)
* Does not depend on underlying web framework
* Supports multiple storage mechanisms (Filesystem, SQL)
* Example code to help you get started
* Test suite

==Getting Started

Please read the INSTALL file, and then have a look at the examples
directory.  A fully functional example using Ruby's WEBrick HTTP
server library is available.  I encorage you to run the example, and
have a look at the code.

The library is well documented.  To get started, have a look at the
example source code(examples/consumer.rb) and OpenID::OpenIDConsumer.

The library and dependancies have been tested using Ruby 1.8,
though it may work with earlier versions.
